Currently, only the 'models' folder is in use.

Dataset Organization

'startup' folder structure is a proposed format for organizing datasets.

Each dataset has a root folder that is named for that dataset.

All of the enclosed contents of the folder belong to the dataset, 
and any shared resources, such as texture maps are placed in the
globals sub-directories.

The globals folder would also hold the presets (1,2,3).

When saving a new dataset a new directory would be created that has
sub-directories for each data type, (ie: csv, images, models, etc....)

Datasets could also support embedding, where if you place a dataset
folder into another datasets sub-directories, then it would load with
the dataset, while using localized resources to that dataset.
