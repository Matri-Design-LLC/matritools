legacy-csv-folder.txt 2021-01-25

This is the legacy CSV tables folder.

Legacy support will LOAD presets (eg. antz0001node.csv) from here, but
on SAVE (SHIFT+1) the preset files will be REMOVED from this folder and
a new folder will be created that is named with the preset and contains
a similar set of files (eg. '../usr/antz0001/csv/antz0001node.csv').
