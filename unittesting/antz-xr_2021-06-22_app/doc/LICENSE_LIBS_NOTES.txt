commercial products. However, SOME libraries have RESTRICTED licensing.

to verify the licensing terms of each library.

- zSpace -
Permission was granted to distribute code that calls the zSpace library,
but you will need to download and install the SDK separately.

- MySQL -
MySQL allows for open source projects to distribute under the GPL, but other
commercial projects require an agreement with Oracle. Alternately you could 
replace MySQL client with the MariaDB client which is LGPL.

- BMD -
Blackmagic Designs sample code is open source friendly, SDK needs to be 
downloaded from them.

- AJA -
AJA SDK requires signing an NDA and has export restrictions. However, in
discussions it was indicated that we can distribute our code calling upon
there SDK as we are not using the portions of the SDK that are under export
restrictions.  We have not formalized this, but plan to do so.

- nVidia -
CUDA SDK needs to be downloaded from nVidia.

- 3Dconnexion -
Space Mouse family is supported with the 3Dconnexion (3dx) library.
